# Purpose #

Honeyguide is a project meant to assist the HCV Target team with data analysis using QUAIL to pull
data and redash as the front end.

# Getting started #


## pre reqs ##

you need:
 1. docker (mac $ brew install docker)
 2. compose (mac $ brew install docker-compose)
 3. docker app (mac $ brew cask install docker)
 4. Start docker app manually. 
 5. increase memory to ~8gb or more

Make sure you have docker, docker-compose and an internet connection.

Copy the `fake.env` file and rename it to `.env`.

Fill in the correct info. If you decide to change the redash password then make sure to change it
in the connection string as well.

Run `docker-compose up --build`

Go to `localhost:8080` and log into redash!

# Adding a datasource #

When using redash and adding a datasource you have two options. One is to use the postgres instance and
information, the other is to add the sqlite databases that are made by quail itself.

## Postgres databases ##

The only thing to note here is that the hostname of the postgres instance is the same as the key of the
service in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

## Sqlite database ##

You can add the sqlite databases themselves as a redash datasource because they are mounted in the redash
container at `/quail_data`

# If a service is killed #

You need to increase the memory limit. There are different ways to do this based on how you are using
docker so you will have to look this up on your own.

# Running a pull without cron #

There is a script that can be run from the docker host once the containers are running that will
allow one to pull whenever they want.
